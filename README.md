📰 Fake News Detection using BERT — Overview
🔍 What is Fake News Detection?
Fake news detection is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that classifies news articles or headlines as "real" or "fake". It plays a crucial role in combating misinformation across social media and news platforms.

🧠 Why Use BERT?
BERT is a transformer-based model developed by Google, pretrained on massive text corpora. It’s excellent for understanding context, semantics, and sentence relationships, making it powerful for detecting subtle misinformation cues in news articles.

Advantages:

Captures context bidirectionally

State-of-the-art accuracy on many NLP tasks

Fine-tuning BERT requires relatively small labeled datasets

⚙️ Architecture Overview
Input Layer

A news headline or full article.

Tokenized using BERT tokenizer: adds [CLS], [SEP], etc.

BERT Base Model

Outputs contextual embeddings.

The [CLS] token’s embedding represents the entire sequence.

Classification Head

A small feedforward layer (usually 1–2 dense layers) takes the [CLS] embedding and outputs logits for "real" or "fake".

Output

A binary label: 0 = Fake, 1 = Real
